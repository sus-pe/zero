# Welcome to Project Zero

This is a pygame engine developed in the spirit of the TDD style detailed in the amazing book
`Growing Object Oriented Software`.

Pre-commit hooks are the single source of truth in this project.

If you want to know how something is done - take a look at `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
